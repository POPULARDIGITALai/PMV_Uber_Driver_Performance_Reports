[server]
enableCORS = false
```

And add this environment variable setting by creating a `packages.txt` file:
```
PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python
```

Wait - that won't work either. Let me give you the **real solution** - upgrade Streamlit, because `uv` is actively fighting against old protobuf versions:
```
streamlit==1.28.0
protobuf==4.24.4
